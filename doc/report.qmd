## 1. Experimental Setup

### Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of 2000 observations of customer purchasing behavior with 8 features. The data includes demographic information such as sex, marital status, age, education level, income, occupation, and settlement size. The data contains no missing values.

Initial exploratory analysis revealed:
- Slightly more male than female customers
- Equal distribution of marital status
- Right-skewed age distribution (mean: 35 years, std: ~12 years)
- Most customers have high school education
- Right-skewed income distribution (mean: $120,000, std: $38,000)
- Most customers are employed or self-employed
- Most customers live in small cities

### Preprocessing Steps

The preprocessing pipeline included:

1. Selecting relevant features for clustering: Income, Age, and Education

2. Applying log transformation to the Income variable to address its right-skewed distribution

3. Standardizing numerical features (Income and Age) using StandardScaler to ensure equal contribution to the clustering algorithm

### Clustering Methodology

I implemented K-means clustering with the following approach:

1. Used K-means++ initialization method to improve convergence and avoid poor local optima

2. Determined the optimal number of clusters using both WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares) and Silhouette Coefficient

3. Trained the final model with the selected optimal K value

4. Predicted cluster assignments for each customer

## 2. Visualization and Interpretation

### Optimal Number of Clusters
I evaluated K values ranging from 2 to 15 using both WCSS and Silhouette scores:

Based on the elbow method, the rate of WCSS decrease slows down between K=4 and K=5. 2. A highest score is around $K=5$. Note that different run could result in differnt graphs, but generaly the performance is better around $K=5$.
. Considering both metrics and the need for practical, interpretable customer segments, I selected K=5 as the optimal number of clusters.

### Clustering Results

Since education was a categorical feature, using scatter plot will result in overlapping of point across a horizontal line making it harder to interpret each cluster. Thus, I opted to use swarm plot as shown in @fig-swarm

### Cluster Interpretation

Based on the analysis, I identified five distinct customer segments:

| Cluster | Count | Income (Mean) | Age (Mean) | Education (Most Common) |
|:-------:|:-----:|:-------------:|:----------:|:-----------------------:|
| 0       | 293   | Lowest (70k)  | Young 20-40 (30) | Mostly high school (~200) |
| 1       | 334   | Highest (170k)| Young 20-40 (33) | Mostly high school (~250) |
| 2       | 234   | High (150k)   | High >40 (60)    | Mostly university (~180)  |
| 3       | 442   | Mid (110k)    | Mid >30 (42)     | Mostly high school (~350) |
| 4       | 697   | Mid (110k)    | Young <30        | Mostly high school (~550) |

### Marketing Strategies

**Cluster 0: Budget-Conscious Young Adults**

- **Profile:** Young adults with low income and mostly high school education

- **Strategy:** Offer affordable essential products with clear value propositions. Focus on mobile and social media marketing channels that emphasize cost-effectiveness and practical benefits.

**Cluster 1: Affluent Young Professionals**

- **Profile:** Young customers with the highest income level, mostly high school graduates

- **Strategy:** Target with premium, trendy products and experiential offerings. Leverage digital influencer marketing and platforms frequented by affluent young consumers.

**Cluster 2: Established Professionals**

- **Profile:** Older customers with high income and university education

- **Strategy:** Offer high-quality, premium products or services. Emphasize comfort, reliability, and long-term benefits through professional channels and publications.

**Cluster 3: Middle-Income Mature Segment**

- **Profile:** Middle-aged customers with moderate income, mostly high school educated

- **Strategy:** Market practical family or lifestyle improvement products at mid-range 
price points. Highlight value and dependability with relatable messaging.

**Cluster 4: Young Middle-Income Group**

- **Profile:** Young customers with moderate income, predominantly high school educated

- **Strategy:** Attract with promotions for popular items and affordable lifestyle enhancements. Focus on social media engagement to build community and brand loyalty.
